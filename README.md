# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python project that checks how strong a password is.

The program takes a password as input and analyzes it based on:

- Minimum length (at least 8 characters)
- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special characters

Based on these conditions, it classifies the password as Weak, Medium, or Strong. It also shows details about which conditions are satisfied and which are missing.

I built this project to practice string methods, loops, and conditional statements in Python. It helped me improve my logical thinking and understand how password validation works.
